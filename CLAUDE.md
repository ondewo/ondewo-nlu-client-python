# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Working Principles

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common mistakes. They bias toward caution over speed; for trivial tasks, use judgment.

### Think before coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### Simplicity first

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### Surgical changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it and delete it — but **prove it is dead first**.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that _your_ changes made unused.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Proving code is dead

"No importer" is not proof. A symbol can be reached without ever appearing in an `import`
statement, and each such consumer needs its own check before you delete anything:

- **Packaging metadata is consumed by installers, not by imports.** `[project].dependencies` in
  `pyproject.toml` exists so that `pip install ondewo-nlu-client` pulls the package into a _user's_
  environment. Grepping this repo for `import x` says nothing about whether a downstream consumer
  needs it — and dropping a genuinely required entry produces an `ImportError` that only surfaces
  after release, in someone else's venv. Read what actually imports the symbol **in the shipped
  package** (`ondewo/`), and remember that a dependency can legitimately be needed at build time
  (`[build-system].requires`) or only by `examples/` / the dev extra.
- **Strings, not identifiers.** Reflection (`getattr`, `importlib`), entry points, Makefile targets,
  `git add` paths, and Docker build steps reference files and symbols by name as text.
- **Generated code.** `ondewo/nlu/services/*.py` is emitted by `generate_services.py`, not written by
  hand. Deleting from the output without touching the generator means the next `make generate_services`
  puts it straight back.
- **Config that lints itself.** mypy's `warn_unused_configs` reports an override section as unused
  only for the scope it was run over: `faker.*`, `polling.*` and `tqdm.*` look dead under
  `mypy ondewo tests` and are live under `mypy ondewo tests examples`. Run the union scope.

If you cannot prove a thing is unreferenced, leave it and say so. Deleting live code is far worse
than leaving dead code.

### Goal-driven execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

These guidelines are working if: fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and
clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Logging

```python
from loguru import logger as log
```

- **Levels:** `log.trace()`, `log.debug()`, `log.info()`, `log.warning()`, `log.error()`, `log.exception()`. Choose by
  hotness/verbosity — `trace` for per-token / hot-path detail, `debug` for routine method entry/exit, `info` for notable
  lifecycle events, `warning` / `error` / `exception` for problems.
- **Interpolate with f-strings, not loguru's `{}` positional args.** Consistent with the Code Style rule, use
  `f"…{value}"`; only add the `f` prefix when the string actually interpolates (`"START: …"` with no params stays a
  plain string).
- **`START:` / `DONE:` bracketing.** Wrap a method (or other notable operation) with a `START:` line at entry and a
  `DONE:` line at exit, both naming `ClassName: method_name` (append `: param={value}` context where useful):

  ```python
  log.debug("START: IntentBertClassifier: predict")
  ...
  log.debug(f"DONE: IntentBertClassifier: predict. Elapsed time: {perf_counter() - start_time:.5f}")
  ```

- **Timing uses `perf_counter()`, rendered `:.5f`.** Measure elapsed time with `time.perf_counter()` captured as a start
  value and subtracted at the `DONE:` line; always format the elapsed value with the `:.5f` spec:

  ```python
  from time import perf_counter

  start_time: float = perf_counter()
  ...
  log.info(f"DONE: SESSION SERVICER: DetectIntent. Elapsed time: {perf_counter() - start_time:.5f}")
  ```

  Never measure a duration with `time.time()` — reserve `time.time()` for wall-clock timestamps (epoch seconds persisted
  to a DB / proto, unique-id or filename stamps). `perf_counter()` has an undefined epoch and must not be stored or
  compared across processes.

## Docstrings

Google-style, triple double-quotes:

```python
"""
Short imperative summary line.

Args:
    param_name (type):
        Description of the parameter.

Returns:
    type:
        Description of the return value.

Raises:
    ExceptionType:
        When this exception is raised.
"""
```

## Git Commits

- **Never include Claude as author or co-author** in commit messages, PR descriptions, or any other text. Do not add
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude…` trailers, "Generated with Claude Code" footers, or any similar attribution.
- The user's own git author identity (already configured in git) is the only identity that should appear on commits.
- This rule overrides the default Claude Code commit-template guidance.
- **Never prepend the JIRA ticket ID** (e.g. `[OND211-2386]`) to the commit subject yourself. The `giticket` pre-commit
  hook reads the ticket from the branch name (`(feature|bugfix|support|hotfix)/<TICKET>-…`) and prepends `[<ticket>]`
  (with a trailing space) automatically. Writing the prefix manually produces a duplicate like
  `[OND211-2386] [OND211-2386] feat: …`. Write the subject as plain Conventional Commits (`feat: …`, `fix(scope): …`,
  `docs(types): …`) and let the hook add the prefix on commit.

## General Principles

- Follow existing patterns before introducing new abstractions.
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with surrounding code.
- Validate inputs early with descriptive, context-rich error messages.
- Use context managers for files, sockets, and thread pools.
- Prefer region comments for grouping methods in files that already use them.
- End edited Markdown and YAML files with a trailing newline.

## Regenerating stubs after an API change

Point the `ondewo-nlu-api` submodule at the api commit
(`git -C ondewo-nlu-api fetch origin <branch> && git -C ondewo-nlu-api checkout <api-sha>`), then run
**both** generators — they are different:

- `make generate_ondewo_protos` — the `*_pb2.py` / `*_pb2.pyi` / `*_pb2_grpc.py` family.
- `make generate_services` — the hand-generator that produces `ondewo/nlu/services/*.py` (+
  `create_async_services` derives `async_*.py` / `client.py`). **A new RPC needs THIS too**, or the
  service client has no method for it. A server-streaming RPC generates a method returning
  `Iterator[<ResponseMessage>]` (async: `AsyncIterator[…]`) in `services/<service>.py`. Do **not** run the
  full `make build` (it resets the submodule off your commit). Verified 2026-07-19 (OND211-2418): the
  container-logs RPCs needed both generators; running only `generate_ondewo_protos` leaves
  `services/operations.py` without the new methods. Commit the `_pb2*` + `services/*` changes together with
  the submodule pointer; push and hand the client SHA to cai's `pyproject.toml` pin.

## Release gotchas (hard-won this session)

These bit us during the 6.14.0 release. Keep them in mind when releasing.

- **Trust the registry, not the log.** `make release_all_clients` wraps each client in `|| echo "Already released …"`, so a _failed_ release is reported as "done". After any release, verify the GitHub release **and** the published package (PyPI / npm) directly.
- **`npm install failed after 5 attempts` in a release log is usually a red herring** — that text is the echo _inside_ the docker `RUN for i in 1..5; do npm install …` retry loop, not a real failure (`npm install` succeeds → `#10 DONE`). Look further down for the real error (a TTY error, an eslint failure, a `setup.py` error).
- **Codegen must run TTY-free.** The `docker run` that invokes the proto-compiler must not pass `-it` — non-interactively it fails with `cannot attach stdin to a TTY-enabled container because stdin is not a terminal`. Fix the script (drop `-it`), or run the whole release under a pseudo-TTY: `script -qc 'make …' /dev/null`.
- **Release Makefiles print secrets.** Some `docker run … -e <TOKEN>=…` recipe lines lack a leading `@`, so `make` echoes the expanded token. Rotate any token printed during a release; fix by prefixing the recipe line with `@`.
- The release auto-pulls the **latest** `ondewo-proto-compiler` tag.
- **npm package names are inconsistent** — e.g. the JS client publishes as `@ondewo/ondewo-nlu-client-js` (double `ondewo`), not `@ondewo/nlu-client-js`. Check `src/package.json`'s `name` before querying npm.
- **PyPI build needs setuptools.** The release image (`Dockerfile.utils`) is `python:3.12-slim`, which bundles no `setuptools`, so `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` dies with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'setuptools'`. `Dockerfile.utils` must `pip install … setuptools wheel`.

## Python tooling — uv + ruff + mypy + pyproject.toml (this session's refactor)

This repo was migrated off `setup.py` / `.flake8` / `mypy.ini` to a single **pyproject.toml** with **uv**, **ruff**, and **mypy**. Going forward:

- **Build backend stays setuptools** (for PyPI compatibility). Build with `python -m build --no-isolation` or `uv build` — NOT `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` (setup.py is deleted). `Dockerfile.utils` installs `twine setuptools wheel build`.
- **Dependencies via uv + a committed `uv.lock`.** CI runs `uv sync --extra dev --frozen`. To add/change a dep: edit `[project.dependencies]`/`[project.optional-dependencies].dev` in pyproject.toml then `uv lock`.
- **Lint is ruff** (`[tool.ruff]`, line-length 120, generated `*_pb2*` excluded) — `uv run ruff check .`. flake8 is gone.
- **mypy config lives in `[tool.mypy]`.** Do **NOT** re-create `mypy.ini` — it silently _shadows_ the pyproject config. Generated `*_pb2*` modules get `ignore_errors` overrides.
- **Do NOT re-add `setup.py`** — with setuptools>=61 it conflicts with `[project]` on duplicated metadata.
- **PEP 625**: the sdist is now underscore-normalised (`ondewo_<name>-<v>.tar.gz`); anything that greps the tarball name by hand must use underscores.
- The version-bump release target edits the version in **pyproject.toml** (not setup.py); the release stages `pyproject.toml uv.lock`.

## uv migration — completed conversion (this session)

The repo is now fully on **uv** (not just pyproject.toml):

- `make setup_developer_environment_locally` bootstraps uv (installs it if missing), runs `uv sync --extra dev` (creates `.venv` + installs all runtime+dev deps + pre-commit), then `uv run pre-commit install`. **No conda** — the old `create_conda_env`/`setup_conda_env` scaffolding was removed.
- Every Makefile target uses uv: `uv sync --extra dev` (deps), `uv run pytest`/`ruff`/`mypy` (tools), `uv build` (wheel). No `pip install`, no `python -m build`, no `python setup.py`.
- New targets: `make ruff` / `make ruff_fix` / `make ruff_format` / `make mypy`. The `flake8` target is **removed**.
- Removed for good: `requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `setup.cfg` — deps + tool config live in `pyproject.toml`. Do **not** re-add them.
- `Dockerfile.utils` installs uv (`COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv`) and builds with uv; it no longer `COPY`s `requirements.txt`.
- **`[tool.mypy] python_version` must be `3.12`** wherever numpy 2.x is on the mypy path — its PEP-695 `type X = …` stubs fail to parse on < 3.12.
- The release `git commit` uses **`--no-verify`** so pre-commit hooks never gate an automated release.
- **Validated by a real PyPI publish** — `ondewo-t2s-client 6.5.0` was built with `uv build` and uploaded via twine end-to-end; the uv release pipeline works.

## Jenkins — never trigger a multibranch scan or branch indexing

**NEVER trigger a Jenkins multibranch scan or branch indexing.** Do not call a multibranch/folder job's
`build`, `scan`, or reindex endpoints, click "Scan Repository Now" / "Build Now" on a folder, run
`p4 scan`, or use any API/CLI that reindexes branches or scans the repository. A scan/reindex runs across
**every** branch, consumes CI resources, and can kick off unintended builds and deploys.

If a branch is not building — it was not discovered, or its job is marked `buildable: false` / orphaned —
**report it and stop**. Let the user or a Jenkins admin adjust branch-discovery/config or rename the branch
to the convention. Never force a build by scanning or reindexing.
